- Goal: sound based trilateration with 3 different beacons.
- New term:
  - `Target`: the device that commuicates with the beacons to be localised.

## Meta problems to solve:
- [ ] What are our time lines? (Should we make a Gantt chart?)
- [ ] What is our budget?
- [ ] How will we contribute to/distribute hardware resources?
- [ ] What is our Git workflow?
- [ ] What is our coding workflow? Should we use a virtual environment and does it matter?

## Problems to solve:
- [ ] Calculate the distance between a sound-based beacon and trigger at ~10m
- [ ] Develop a handshake method between a sound-based beacon and target (using radio module)
- [ ] Localize and handshake between 2 beacons
- [ ] Localize and handshake betweeen 3 beacons
- [ ] Creat a way to map each beacon relative to each other
- [ ] Create a mapping software

## ** Checkpoint **
- [ ] Re-evaluate our interest in the project
  - [ ] If still interested, determine the next steps
      - Should we find a prof?     
- [ ] Polish the project for employers
- [ ] find prof? **

## Future Work:
- [ ] Have beacons localize themselves with respect to each other (or an origin)
- [ ] 3-D localization
- [ ] Infuse each beacon with GPS coordinates
- [ ] Adapt this concept with radio waves
