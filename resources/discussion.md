- Goal: sound based trilateration, with 3 different beacons.
- New term:
  - Target: the device that commuicates with the beacons to be localised.
- Problem to solve:
[ ] Calculate the distance between a sound-based beacon and trigger at ~10m
[ ] Develop a handshake method between a sound-based beacon and target (using radio module)
[ ] Localize and handshake between 2 beacons
[ ] Localize and handshake betweeen 3 beacons
[ ] Creat a way to map each beacon relative to each other
[ ] Create a mapping software
** Checkpoint - find prof? **

Future Work:
[ ] Have beacons localize themselves with respect to each other (or an origin)
[ ] 3-D localization
[ ] Infuse each beacon with GPS coordinates
[ ] Adapt this concept with radio waves
